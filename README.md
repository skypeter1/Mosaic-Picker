# Webpack Mosaic Picker

This project uses webpack2 to build a nice looking mosaic picker

To get started clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/skypeter1/webpack`

Please make sure that you have the required npm version for this case

I have built and script that uses nvm to set the version that I use for this example, so please feel free to use it would not overwrite any other npm or node version that you have installed.

`./start.sh`

Then go to root directory and install node modules

`npm install`


### To run using webpack dev server

`npm run dev-server`

### To run on production

`npm run prod`
